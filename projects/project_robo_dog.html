									<h3 id="idea">The Idea</h3>
									<p>
										Dogs are a person’s best friend. 
										Imagine having one that helps you like a true companion on every DIY project—handing you tools or fetching the parts you need. 
										<br>Of course, for animal welfare reasons, it wouldn’t be a real dog, but a robotic one.
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/ai_dog.png"></img>
										</div>
									</p>
									<h4>Functionality</h4>
									<p>
										The robotic dog should be able to follow its owner autonomously and carry parts or tools in a tray on its back. Due to a lack of qualified recievers which fit in the skaled dog, the first version will be controlled with a webserver and has no autonomous function.
									</p>
									<h4>Realistic Prototype</h4>
									<p>
										Since strong servos are quite expensive, the prototype was scaled down.
										The prototype should consist of 3D-printed body parts and 4 legs with 2 degrees of freedom each, driven by servos.
										The tray on the back should be able to carry small parts and should be detachable.
									</p>
									</p>
									<h4>Control</h4>
									<p>
										Even so John Bradnam already provided code for walking gaits, all code was developed from scratch.
										The control components differ from the original design, too. <br>
										The robotic dog is controlled by an ESP32 and the MG90S servos are controlled via a PCA9685 servo driver board. <br>
										Following the owner is realized with the help of two RXB6 recievers which locate a 433 MHz transmitter held by the owner.
									</p>
									<h3 id="threeD">3D-Models</h3>
									<p>
										The basis for the robotic dog are 3D models from John Bradnam on <a href="https://www.hackster.io/john-bradnam/robot-dog-boston-cbc763" target="_blank">www.hackster.io</a>. 
										Many changes were nessesary to fit the components which should be used and make the carrying function possible. This is discribed on <a href="https://nora-1125.github.io/Website/ProjectRoboDog.html">Noras project site</a>, because she did major part of 3D-Design. All code and the parts are provided in a <a href="https://github.com/JD1108/RoboticDog">GitHub respository</a>
									</p>
									
									<h3 id="gait">Walking Gait</h3>
									<p>
										The first version of the robotic dog has no interial measurement unit (IMU) and therefore no feedback control. Hence the walking gait had to be very stable and is only based on time. <br>
										Therefore, a walking gait was developed where the robot always has three legs on the ground. <br>
										The walking gait is based on four phases. In each phase, one leg is lifted, moved forward and set down again, while the other three legs provide stability. <br>
										The following pattern is used:
										<ol>
											<li>left front leg</li>
											<li>right rear leg</li>
											<li>right front leg</li>
											<li>left rear leg</li>
										</ol>
										There maybe will be more complex and faster walking gaits in future versions.
									</p>
									<h4>Inverse kinematic</h4>
									<p>
										For a smooth walking gait, the servo angles have to be calculated depending on the desired foot position. 
										Therefore, an inverse kinematic for the legs was developed. Each leg has two degrees of freedom, which are controlled by two servos. <br>
										The following figure shows the a model of one leg:
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/leg_ik.png"></img>		
										</div>
										The distance between hip and foot kann be calculated with the Pythagorean theorem:
										<div style="text-align: center;">

										</div>
									If X and Y are the coordinates of the foot with respect to the hip, d is the distance between hip and foot. <br>
									With the cosine law, the angles of the servos can be calculated:

									<br>
									This are the formulas for the inverse kinematic of one leg. <br>
									With these formulas, the servo angles can be calculated depending on the desired foot position.
									So it is possible to define smooth trajectories for the feet during the walking gait.
									</p>
									<h4>Movement of the legs</h4>
									<p>
										With the help of the inverse kinematic, it is possible to define trajectories for a feet in x and y dimension. <br>
										There are some requirements for the trajectories during the walking gait: <br>
										<ul>	
											<li>The foot has to be lifted during the forward movement.</li>
											<li>The foot has to move smoothly.</li>
											<li>The foot has to be set down smoothly.</li>
											<li>The foot has to be accelarated smoothly.</li>
										</ul>
										These requirements can be fulfilled with a Bezier curve of fourth order which is shown below. <br>

										Where P0 to P4 are the control points of the Bezier curve and t is a parameter between 0 and 1. <br>
										The following curve is used for the foot trajectory during the walking gait:
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/leg_tr.png"></img>
										</div>
										The animation below shows either the movement of one leg or all four legs during the walking gait. <br>
										As described above, the walking gait is divided into four phases. <br>
										In each phase, one leg is lifted, moved forward and set down again, while the other three legs provide stability. <br>
										<br>
										Feel free to try it out:
										<br>
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<canvas style="border-radius:6px;"id="ani" width="500" height="520"></canvas>

											<button class="butAni" onclick="animateStepsFour()">Four Legs</button>
											</div>
										</div>
									</p>
									<h4>Simulation of a leg</h4>
									<p>
										Before implementing the walking gait on the real leg, the movement of one leg was simulated in Python. <br>
										This made it possible to verify the moments, speeds und positions.<br>
										It allowed to optimize the walking gait before implementing it on the real robot.
										A maximum weight of 500 g was assumed for the dog which is distributed on three legs on time. 
										The MG90s servos can provide a stall torque of 0.177 Nm which was divided by three for safety reasons. <br>
										The folowing figure shows the results of the simulation:
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/leg_m.png"></img>
										</div>
										This is for a step length of 5 cm which starts 1 cm before the vertical projection of the hip. <br>
										All values are in a safe range for the servos and the variations are continuous and smooth.
										Therefore, the walking gait can be implemented on the real robot. If the robot will be lighter, even bigger step lengths are possible.
									</p>
									<h4>Steering</h4>
									<p>
										Since the robot has a 2 DOF leg which can only move in the sagittal plane, steering is limited like on a tracked vehicle. <br>
										Steering is realized by different step lengths for the left and right legs.
										If the left legs have a bigger step length than the right legs, the robot turns to the right and vice versa. <br>
										The bigger the difference between the step lengths, the sharper the turn.
									</p>
									<h3 id="wire">Wiring</h3>
									<p>
										As already mentioned, the robotic dog is controlled by an ESP32 and the MG90S servos are controlled via a PCA9685 servo driver board. 
										In addition, a 7,4 V 2000 mAh 15C LiPo battery and two XL4015 are used to supply the robot dog with sufficent power.
										The XL4015 convert the battery voltage to 5 V. The servos are connected directly to the XL4015 outputs, four to each.
										The ESP32 and the PCA9685 are also supplied with 5 V from the XL4015 and are interconnected with I<sup>2</sup>C. <br>
										The folowing schematic shows the wiring of the components:
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/schematic_without_radio.png"></img>
										</div>
									</p>
									<h3 id="prog">Programming the ESP32</h3>
									<p>
										The ESP32 was programmed with ESP-IDF in a combination of C and C++ in VS Code. There are two classes one for the I<sup>2</sup>C-bus and one for a leg. They are capsuled in wrappers to be useable in the main programm which is written in C. Since all code is avaiable on <a href="https://github.com/JD1108/RoboticDog">GitHub</a> <br>
										The class Leg includes the trajectories and the inverse kinematic and allows to build four objects of type Leg which have its own step height, step length and height, but use a step time together.
									</p>
									<h4>Debugging</h4>
									<p>
										For testing the software and for debugging, there is debug.c file which defines functions for usb output. The usb output can be visualized with a python script that animate the legs in time. <br>
										As the following picture shows:
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/debug_animation.png"></img>
										</div>
										
									</p>
									<h4>Web interface</h4>
									<p>
										Since the "Follow Owner"-function isn't implemented yet, the robot is fully controlled with the webinterface.<br>
										The ESP32 creates an accespoint which SSID and passwort must be defined in ESP-IDF.<br>
										When connected, the server is on http://192.168.4.1 and looks like shown below.
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/control.png"></img>
										</div>
										There is a live test version on this website, too.<br>
										Feel free to try it yourself:
										<a href="../project_files/robo_dog/control.html" target="_blank">Here</a>
										
									</p>
									<h3 id="asse">Assembling  </h3>
									<h4>Post treatment of 3D printed parts</h4>
									<p>
										Once the print is finished, the parts looks as shown in the picture below.
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/3dPrintWithSupport.jpeg"></img>
										</div>
										So, the first step is remove the parts from the print bed and remove the supports from parts.	
									</p>
									<h4>Build a leg</h4>
									<p>
										Before assembling the leg, all servos should be in a defined state, so that there are no surprises when the robot starts moving. It is recommanded to use the calibration web interface and set all angles to 90 degrees. <br>
										First, the hip servo is screwed to the hip element. Then, the thigh is set on the gearwheel of the servo is screwed tight. There are different parts for left and right, so it is important to use the right ones. In the next step, the knee servo is screwed to the tight.
										The following picture shows the current state. 
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/upperLeg.jpeg"></img>
										</div>
										After that, the lower leg is mounted and screwed. The correct orientation is shown in the picture below. The screw has to be tighten carfully, so the leg don't wiggle, but can turn easily.
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/legWoWire.jpeg"></img>
										</div>
										Following this, the lower leg is connected to the servo. Therefore a 1.8&nbsp;mm plastic coated iron wire is bend as shown in the picture.
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/wireB.png"></img>
										</div>
										Inserting the wire finishes the leg.
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/legTop.png"></img>
										</div>
									</p>
									<h4>Wiring and solding</h4>
									<p>
										Most cables are connected via soldering, because it needs less space than other methods. <br>
										First step is the design of the perforated board which is used to distribute the current from the two XL4015.
										As shown in the part <a href="#wire" onclick="onClickScroll(event)"> Wiring</a>, there is only one ground for all components which is important for the interpretation of the i2c and pwm signal.<br>
										One XL4015 5 V is only connected to four servos and the other is connected to four servos and the ESP32 and the PCA9685.<br>
										Due to a defect of the level shifter, the shown dog uses only 3.3V for the PCA9685 from the ESP32. Check if the used servos work with 3.3V pwm signals.
										Short jumper male ends can be used as connection between the board and the servos. The ESP32 (and PCA9685) is connected wie male-female jumper wires which are soldered to the board, too.
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/boardTop.jpeg"></img>
										</div>
										The thicker wires below are connected with the outputs of XL4015s, so the board looks like shown below.
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<img class="image_in_text" src="../images/robo_dog/boardXl.jpeg"></img>
										</div>
										If the battery is connected to the inputs of the XL4015s, the eletric components are built.
										Before connecting something to the board, the output voltage of the XL4015s must be ajusted to 5.0V.

									</p>
									<h4>The body</h4>
									<p>
										
									</p>
									<h4>Calibration</h4>
									<p>
										Before starting the servos, the parameters of the servo must be compared to the cal.h, otherwise the servos could be destroyed. <br>
										For the best result, the robot has to be calibrated. In this version, a complete calibration with the webserver isn't possible.
										When the robot and the software is set up, the "All 90 Degree","All 10 Degree","All 170 Degree" buttons can be used for calibrating. <br>
										If the results are not satisfying, the pwm values in the cal.h can be changed to improve the precision. <br>

										The formula for calibration is: <br>
